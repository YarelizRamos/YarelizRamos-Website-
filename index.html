        <p class="lead mb-4">I am currently a sophmore at UCR. I am a full time student and part-time worker, currently working as a nanny and peer-educator in CHFY at UCR. I commute to University from Los Angeles, which is where I am located. Im currently a Political Science major, but will soon change into Bussness administration, accounting. I found my interest to be shifting these two years I have been attending UCR. <br><br>

        With my 2 jobs, I have developed many skills, such as responsibilty and multitasking. Working with kids of all ages, I have to be constantly making sure of others safety while also going on with the day. Specifically, with my job at UCR, my skills in technology has increased, since, I am teaching to freshmens in three different classes, this also leads to my public speaking skills developing more and more throughout time. I am willing to expand my knowledge and interest with different areas in my work place, school, interneships and many other environments. <br><br>

        Some personal fun facts about me: I like to go hiking, camping or even just walking in nature. I also enjoy the beach a lot during the summer,surfing/bougie boarding everyday is one of my biggest hobbies, last fun fact is I am a person that is overly organized with school/job work but not personal life.
